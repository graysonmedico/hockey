This visualization tracks the goal-scoring evolution of Connor McDavid over the last six seasons, highlighting his unique ability to adapt his game. The chart is anchored by his explosive 2022-23 campaign, where he shattered career highs with 64 goals to win the Rocket Richard Trophy. Notably, the sharp dip to 32 goals in the following season (2023-24) does not signal a decline, but rather a historic shift in strategy: McDavid opted to focus on playmaking, becoming only the fourth player in NHL history to record 100 assists in a single year.
